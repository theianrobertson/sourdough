# Plain White

Largely following this recipe: https://www.theperfectloaf.com/best-sourdough-recipe/

- 804g white
- 73g wholemeal
- 705g (655+50) water
- 18g salt
- 150g levain

- 50 minute autolyze with just flour & water
- 30 minutes after adding levain
- Bulk fermentation should go for about 4 hours. Perform 6 sets of stretch and folds during bulk. The first three are at 15 minute intervals, and the last 3 are at 30 minute intervals. After these folds (2 hours and 15 minutes have gone by) let the dough rest for the remainder of your bulk fermentation (1 hour and 45 minutes).
- Bulk was a bit longer - almost 5 hours.  Veeeery slack again :facepalm:
