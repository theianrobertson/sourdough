# Seeds x 1, Raisin walnut x 1

- 1000g flour - 660 white and 170 spelt, 170 ww
- 250 g leaven - 100% hydration
- 800 g water - 750 to start, 50 more with salt
- 23 g salt - 15 so far...
- First loaf, added with salt:
    + 1/2 cup mixed poppy, sesame and flax seeds
- Second loaf, added just before first turn:
    + 100 g walnuts
    + 50 g raisins
    + 1 tbsp olive oil?
    + 1 tsp cinnamon

- 30 minute autolyze in warm oven
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 6 30 minute folds (had to skip one)
- 2 more hours
- 5 hours total bulk, no fold at end.  Bulked in the oven using cycle on/off proofing because it's cold in my house, other than the last 2 hours.
- Pre-shape
- 30 minutes then final shape, into boule and batard
- Maybe 3 hours then into 450 for 20-20.

## Notes
- Flipping the boule over into a hot pan worked out OK.  Just sprinkled some cornmeal on the loaf, put the pan over the basket and flipped all at once.
- Boule shaping worked well, I think I got good tension.  Batard could use some work on the shaping side.
