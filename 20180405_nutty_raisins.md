# Raisin Walnut

- 460g flour - 253 white, 90 arva white, 117 ww
- 115 g leaven
- 344g water to start, 23 with salt
- 11 g salt
- Added just before first turn (dumped out onto counter, spread on top and mixed gently):
    * 100 g walnuts
    * 50 g raisins
    * 1 tbsp walnut oil
    * 1 tsp cinnamon

- Made levain overnight with 1-1-1 ratios
- First mix ~9:20 am
- 30 minute autolyze
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 6 30 minute folds (though I missed one due to going out), extras mixed in with first, tried to get some tension after third.
- 2 more hours
- 5 hours total bulk, no fold at end.  Bulked on the counter only, and it was a little chilly.
- Pre-shape
- 25 minutes then final shape, into boule.
- Three hours on the counter, just in the basket (no towel), plus a half hour while the oven came to temp (though it was already a bit warm)
- Bake 20-17 at 470-450?
