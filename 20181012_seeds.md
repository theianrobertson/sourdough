  - 65g warm water
- Dough:
  - 250g whole wheat

## Process
- Mixed up levain at 4:30 pm.  Into the oven, cycled the proof on for a few minutes first then kept it in the warmish oven.
- Mix dough sans-levain/salt at 6:45 pm
- Mixed everything together and slapped & folded for a bit at ~9:00
- 3 stretch & folds on the 30s, All barrel-folds.  Add-ins with the second one.
- Into the fridge overnight after third set of folds.
- Took out of the fridge around 7:00 am
- pre-shape around 8:00, shape half an hour later
- On the counter for ~3 hours after final shape, then into the oven
- Baked 25 at 475, then 20 at 450?

## Notes
- I could have let the loaves come up to temperature a bit more before pre-shape.  Maybe in warm oven?
