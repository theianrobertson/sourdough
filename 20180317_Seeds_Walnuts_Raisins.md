# Sesame x 1, Raisin walnut x 1

- 850g flour - 637 white, 213 total ww/spelt
- 212 g leaven
- 637g water to start, 42.5 with salt
- 20 g salt
- Added just before first turn (dumped out onto counter, spread on top and mixed gently):
    + First loaf (~761g):
        * ~1/3 cup of mixed black & white sesame seeds (Maybe a bit more?)
    + Second loaf (~1000g):
        * 100 g walnuts
        * 50 g raisins
        * 1 tbsp walnut oil
        * 1 tsp cinnamon

- Made levain overnight with 1-1-1 ratios
- First mix ~9:00 am
- 30 minute autolyze in warm oven
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 6 30 minute folds, extras mixed in with first, tried to get some tension after third.
- 2 more hours
- 5 hours total bulk, no fold at end.  Bulked in the oven using a bit cycle on/off proofing because it's cold in my house, last 3 hours on the counter.
- Pre-shape
- 30 minutes then final shape, into boule and batard.  Batard gets spritzed and sesame seeded
- Into the fridge around 3:00
- Bake 20-20 at 450?

## Notes
- Light sprinkle with fingers of rice/white flour worked in baskets - didn't need too much.
