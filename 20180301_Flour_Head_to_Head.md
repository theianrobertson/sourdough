# Flour head-to-head
Similar to 20171228, and running a head-to-head flour comparison comparing the miller's pride with the arva flour

## Loaf 1 (pyrex bowl)
- 500g flour - 400 arva, 50 ww, 50 spelt
- 350g water in first mix, 25 with salt, 375 total
- 100g leaven @ 100% hydration
- 77% hydration total
- 11 g salt

## Loaf 2 (Metal bowl)
Same as loaf 1, but with 400g of miller's pride instead of Arva.

## Process
- Levain started at 9:30pm Wednesday

- 30 minute autolyze
- Mixed in salt & water, did some slap & folding (5 minutes-ish?)
- 4 stretch & folds within 30 minutes of each other
- 1 more stretch & folds after 60 minutes
- 60 more minutes, then a bit of a stretch & fold to get out of the bowl
- Pre-shape, 40 minutes, then final shape.  Into proofing baskets.  One stayed on the counter overnight, one was on the counter for a couple of hours then into the fridge.
- Into the oven around 5:50 am (woo babies), 20 on 20 off.
    + Counter loaf didn't rise much in oven (expected) in the dutch oven, and I caught the lip of the pot when dropping it in because it was so saggy.
    + Fridge loaf went into the combo cooker, and looks quite nice
