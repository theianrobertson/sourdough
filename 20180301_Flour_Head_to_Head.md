# Flour head-to-head
Similar to 20171228, and running a head-to-head flour comparison comparing the miller's pride with the arva flour

## Loaf 1 (pyrex bowl)
- 500g flour - 400 arva, 50 ww, 50 spelt
- 350g water in first mix, 25 with salt, 375 total
- 100g leaven @ 100% hydration
- 77% hydration total
- 11 g salt

## Loaf 2 (Metal bowl)
Same as loaf 1, but with 400g of miller's pride instead of Arva.

## Process
- Levain started at 9:30pm Wednesday, with the miller's pride flour.
- Mixed in the morning
- 30 minute autolyze
- Mixed in salt & water, did some slap & folding (3 minutes-ish on each?)
- 4 stretch & folds within 30 minutes of each other
- Did a pre-shape a little over an hour later, and final shape 25 minutes after.
- Proofed on the counter for ~3:30 until into the oven for 20-20
- Arva loaf was not as bad as previous, but still more slack and more difficult to shape.  Stuck to the tea towel too.

## Thoughts
- The miller's pride flour was much nicer to work with.  Arva flour was very sticky, and didn't "come together" as nicely.  Miller's pride loaf was nicer too.
- Maybe try to lower the water for Arva even more?  It was easier to work than previously.
