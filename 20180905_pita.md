Originally at https://www.weekendbakery.com/posts/favorite-flatbreads-sourdough-pita/

## Ingredients
- 400 g white flour (200 each white and arva)
- 100 g whole wheat flour
- 290 g water (260 with autolyze, 30 with starter/levain)
- 9 g (sea) salt
- 20 g sourdough culture (100%)
- 15 g olive oil

## Process
- Mixed starter, 30g each of flour mix and water
- Mixed up rest of flour and water, both of these at 10:30
- Mixed everything together, kneaded and some slap & fold at ~12:30
- On the counter until around 5:30 pm, then into the fridge overnight
- Out of the fridge around 7:00 am
- Oven on around 9:00.  Baking stone, bake at 500, then convection at 540?
- Made into balls of ~100g each, rolled out ~10 minutes after.  Needed quite a bit of flour for rolling
- Used a big cutting board to slide onto baking stone directly
- Baked pitas for 3-4 minutes each, two at a time

## Notes
- Most pitas puffed up with a pocket (whoop)
