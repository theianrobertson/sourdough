# Cheese and tomatoes?

## Ingredients
- 350g flour - 200 white, 90 arva, 60 ww
- 90 g leaven
- 270g water to start, 20 with salt
- 8 g salt

- Added just before first turn (dumped out onto counter, spread on top and mixed gently):
    + 6 cloves garlic, having been minced and sauteed in olive oil until soft
    + Cheddar cheese - 88 g in ~0.5cm cubes - 8 thickish slices chopped up
    + 5 Sun-dried tomatoes, diced

## Process
- Made levain overnight with 1-1-1 ratios
- First mix ~8:00 am
- 35 minute autolyze
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 4 15 minute folds, extras mixed with first
- 4 30 minute folds
- 2 more hours
- 5 hours total bulk, no fold at end.
- Pre-shape
- 25 minutes, 20 covered and 5 uncovered, then final shape, into batard
- Into the fridge around 2:00
- Bake 20-20 at 450, in the oven at 6:15 the next morning

## Notes
- Very tasty.  Smaller cheese cubes than last time lead to better cheese distribution
  through the loaf.  Not the greatest rise, but great flavour.
