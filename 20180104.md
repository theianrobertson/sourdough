# Light seeds?
Original thoughts from Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc2eFICH7yY/

- 500g flour - 450 white and 50 spelt
- 100 g leaven - 100% hydration
- 417 g water - 390 to start, 27 more with salt
- 11 g salt
- 1/2 cup seeds - mixed black & white sesame and poppy seeds
- 85% hydration

- 30 minute autolyze in warm oven
- Cut in salt & seeds with water
- 4 30 minute folds
- 1 1hr fold
- 4 hours total bulk, no fold at end.  Bulked in the oven using cycle on/off proofing because it's cold in my house
- Gentle shape - maybe could have used a bit more bulk ferment
- In fridge overnight - 14 hours total? And baked right out of fridge in Dutch oven.

## trevorjaywilson comments on Instagram:
- I piggybacked folds every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours (4 sets of folds)
- With the last piggyback fold I inverted the dough (seam down) so I could give it a higher tension fold
- Then another tension fold an hour after that. So 5 sets of folds total.
- Then just tipped it out after 4 hours of bulk (no folds to remove).
- It was pretty proofy, which is where most of the dough strength came from, but still fairly slack.
- Required a very gentle shaping (lightly stitched) or would've degassed too much.
- Into the refrigerator right away for an overnight retard, then baked straight from the fridge about 16 hours later.

## Thoughts
- Could have used a slightly longer bulk - it was still a bit slack shaping
- Slashes didn't open up much - maybe warm up after fridge?  Or let it rise a bit pre-fridge?
- I didn't get the seeds very well distributed - either need to get them in with the dry mix or cut them in better.
