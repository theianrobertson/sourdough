Just a repo where I'm storing information about bread-making, in case I lose my data.

## Links

- I've had some great luck with recipes from [The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com).
  - The [beginner sourdough](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/beginners-sourdough-bread/) is a pretty
  good start.
- [Trevor J Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRK2AFfEfjhFcpYtu44Uzvw) has some good technique
  videos, and a great e-book for trying to get an open crumb
- I liked [Chad Robertson's Tartine Bread book](https://www.amazon.ca/Tartine-Bread-Chad-Robertson/dp/0811870413) for starting out

## My notes and recipes

The notes in this repo are mostly short-hand, so may be hard to follow.  I'd be happy to discuss
anything contained herein though, so please reach out or open an issue if you'd like :)

So far things are just organized by dates on the files, may organize things differently over time.
