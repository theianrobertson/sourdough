## Ingredients
- Levain:
  - 25g starter from fridge
  - 50g Arva White
  - 50g whole wheat
  - 90g warm water
- Dough:
  - 100g whole wheat
  - 900g White (750 white, 150 arva)
  - 800g water (700g with dough mix, 100 with salt/levain if necessary)
  - 20g salt
  - 150g levain

## Process
- Mixed up levain around 6:45 am
- Mix dough sans-levain/salt at 9:45 am
- Mixed everything together and slapped & folded for a bit at ~12:45
- 3 stretch & folds on the 30s, second got some tension
- Pre-shape around 6:30 pm
- Shape around 7:00 pm
- On the counter for 1.5 hours
- In the fridge at 8:45 pm
- Baked 20 at 475 with lid on, 10 down to 450, then 25 at 450 with lid off

## Notes
- Very nice bread.  Crust is nicely caramelized, and nice soft interior.
- Got a good rise on this - I think the shaping worked out well, got some good tension.
