# 2018-02-10 - Oatmeal sourdough!

Based on https://www.theperfectloaf.com/oat-porridge-sourdough/, scaled down to 75%

## Oatmeal
- 375g tap water
- 188g Large flake rolled oats
- Pinch salt

Cooked covered for 16 minutes lowish after bringing to close to a boil.  It stuck some, maybe should have stirred some, or cooked as low as possible (like rice?)

## Dough
- 525g white flour 70%
- 225g whole wheat flour 30%
- 563g water @ 84ºF 75%
- 150g levain 15%

- Mix levain and 525g of total water to mixing bowl and mix with your hand until the levain is completely dissolved
- Add in white and whole wheat flours
- Mix by hand until all the dry ingredients are incorporated
- Cover with wrap and keep covered in a warmish place in your kitchen at around 77-79ºF for 1 hour (oven with brief proof cycle before)

## Post-autolyze
- 19g sea salt
- 19g of the remaining warm H2O (save 19g to help when mixing the oat porridge in later)

- Add in oatmeal with a bit of water if necessary before first turns.
- 6 turns total?
- 4 on the half hour, then one 1.5 hours later #naptime
- 2 hours after last folds
- 20 minutes between pre-shape and shape
- Spritz with water after shape, and roll in rolled oats on a tea towel
- Baked without overnight in the fridge - just ~2 hours on the counter.  20 lid on, 20 lid off.

## Notes
- Bread was very moist and tasty.  Dense but not too dense.
- Maybe could have benefitted from being in the fridge overnight, but it was pretty good either way.
