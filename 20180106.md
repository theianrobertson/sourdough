# Beer bread numero uno

## Ingredients
- 1000g flour - 850 white, 50 ww, 100 spelt
- 600 g beer from the fridge, Beau's
- 100g quite hot water in first mix, 50 with salt, 750 total liquid
- 200g leaven @ 100% hydration
- 22 g salt

## Process
- 30 minute autolyze
- Mixed in salt & water, did some slap & folding (5 minutes-ish?)
- 4 stretch & folds within 30 minutes of each other
- 1 more stretch & folds after 60 minutes
- Third fold and remaining did the bottom stretch thing
- 60 more minutes, then a bit of a stretch & fold to get out of the bowl
- Used the new little banneton, for just under half of the dough (932 g with the basket - it was OK in that basket)

## Thoughts
- Getting the little banneton right into the combo cooker was relatively easy
- The small batard opened up decently, but not much lip to speak of.  Try to cut at a shallower angle next time?
