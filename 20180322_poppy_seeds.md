# Poppy'd

- 850g flour - 550 white, 200 arva white, 100 ww
- 212 g leaven
- 1/3 cup poppy seeds
- 637g water to start, 42.5 with salt
- 20 g salt

- Made levain overnight with 1-1-1 ratios

- 30 minute autolyze in warm oven
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 6 30 minute folds, extras mixed in with first, tried to get some tension after third.
- 2 more hours
- 5 hours total bulk, no fold at end.  Bulked in the oven using a bit cycle on/off proofing because it's cold in my house, last 3 hours on the counter.
- Pre-shape
- 25 minutes then final shape, into boule and batard.
- Into the fridge around 5:15
- Bake 20-18 at 475

## Notes
- Dough was nice to work with, not too sticky.  Maybe try upping the percent of Arva?
- Base of boule was a little dense.
