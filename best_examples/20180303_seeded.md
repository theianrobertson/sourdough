# Seeds

- 800g flour - 650 white and 75 spelt, 75 ww
- 200 g leaven - 100% hydration
- 640 g water - 600 to start, 40 more with salt
- 19 g salt
- 1/2 cup mixed poppy, sesame seeds

- Mixed levain at 7:00 am
- Dough mix at 12 noon
- 30 minute autolyze in warm oven
- Cut in salt and seeds, with some slap & folding
- 6 30 minute folds
- 1 more hour
- 4 hours total bulk, no fold at end.  Bulked a bit in the oven using cycle on/off proofing because it's cold in my house, but not too warm.
- Pre-shape
- 20 minutes uncovered then final shape, into boule and batard.  Batard shaping instructions from [the perfect loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/seeded-sourdough/) seemed to work well.  The batard looked pretty strong after shape.
- Spritz and sesame seeds on top (on a tea towel)
- Into the fridge around 5:30 pm
- Baked at 475 for 20 with lid, 450 for 20 with no.  Oven on around 7:00 am.

## Notes
- Very good.  The stitching batard shape was a good one.  V. nice crumb in there and flavour is nice.
