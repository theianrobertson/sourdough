# Rosemary Garlic - first with Arva flour

Leaven:
- 133 g each of water, starter (fridge), white flour.

- 1000g flour - 750 white, 50 rye, 100 spelt, 100 ww
- 250 g leaven - 100% hydration
- 800 g water - 750 to start, 50 more with salt
- 23 g salt
- Added just before first turn:
    + Roasted garlic
    + Rosemary

- 30 minute autolyze in warm oven
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 6 30 minute folds (had to skip one)
- 2 more hours
- Veeeery slack.  Not sure if I should have let it ferment longer?  Maybe try that next time.
- Overnight in the fridge, then baked 20-20 lid on/off at 460-450

## Notes
- This was quite tasty, but didn't rise very much.  I used a bit less flour in the baskets and it still came out pretty easily tohugh, so that's good.
