# Cranberry Walnut
Based on Tartine, https://www.theperfectloaf.com/walnut-cranberry-sourdough/

## Ingredients
- 500g flour - 400 white, 50 ww, 50 spelt
- 425g water in first mix at 86, 25 with salt, 750 total
- 125g leaven @ 100% hydration
- 11 g salt
- 100g mixed walnuts, toasted pepitas, toasted sesame seeds, sunflower seeds
- 75g cranberry sauce

## Process
- Dough mix at 9:20
- 30 minute autolyze
- Mixed in salt & water, did some slap & folding
- 4 stretch & folds within 30 minutes of each other.  Mixed in nuts and sauce with fold 2
- 1 more stretch & folds after 60 minutes
- Last three I tried the tuck-under fold
- 60 more minutes, then preshape.  Quite sticky and soft.
- 25 minutes, then final shape and into basket.
- 3ish hours on the counter?
- Baked for 25 minutes with top on (combo cooker), 20 minutes off at 450 the whole time

## Notes
- I think I maybe should have either left it a bit longer on the counter, or else fermented a bit warmer.  Came out a little dense.
- The walnuts were ðŸ‘Œ, but I couldn't really taste the cranberries.  Would probably need more cranberries, but that would probably also mean cutting down water or using dried.
