# White (mostly)

200g (25%) leaven
600g white flour
75g whole wheat
75g spelt
50g rye
18g salt
600g H2O @ 85ÂºF and 40g H2O with salt

- Levain mix 7:30 am
- Dough mix at 4:10 pm
- 30 minute autolyze

- 6 ~30 minute folds
- 1 more hour
- 4 hours total bulk, no fold at end.  Bulked a bit in the oven using cycle on/off proofing because it's cold in my house, but not too warm.
- Pre-shape
- 20 minutes uncovered then final shape, into boule and batard.  Batard shaping instructions from [the perfect loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/seeded-sourdough/).

## Notes
- Was quite crusty - maybe could have come out of the oven a bit earlier (did 20 475, 20 450)
- Nice crumb - chewy but open
