# Post-Christmas
Based largely on Tartine bread book, some other tips

## Ingredients
- 1000g flour - 900 white, 100 ww
- 700g water in first mix, 50 with salt, 750 total
- 200g leaven @ 100% hydration
- 77% hydration total
- 22 g salt

## Process
- Dough mix at 1:45
- 30 minute autolyze
- Mixed in salt & water, did some slap & folding (5 minutes-ish?)
- 4 stretch & folds within 30 minutes of each other
- 1 more stretch & folds after 60 minutes
- 60 more minutes, then a bit of a stretch & fold to get out of the bowl
- Pre-shape, 40 minutes, then final shape.  Into proofing baskets and on the counter overnight (it's chilly in here though)

## Thoughts
- I think it's probably worth it to use a clean bowl for the bulk ferment.  Quite a bit of sticking to the bowl.
