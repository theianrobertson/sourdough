# Post-Christmas
Based largely on Tartine bread book, some other tips

## Ingredients
- 1000g flour - 900 white, 100 ww
- 700g water in first mix, 50 with salt, 750 total
- 200g leaven @ 100% hydration
- 77% hydration total
- 22 g salt

## Process
- Dough mix at 1:45
- 30 minute autolyze
- Mixed in salt & water, did some slap & folding (5 minutes-ish?)
- 4 stretch & folds within 30 minutes of each other
- 1 more stretch & folds after 60 minutes
- 60 more minutes, then a bit of a stretch & fold to get out of the bowl
- Pre-shape, 40 minutes, then final shape.  Into proofing baskets.  One stayed on the counter overnight, one was on the counter for a couple of hours then into the fridge.
- Into the oven around 5:50 am (woo babies), 20 on 20 off.
    + Counter loaf didn't rise much in oven (expected) in the dutch oven, and I caught the lip of the pot when dropping it in because it was so saggy.
    + Fridge loaf went into the combo cooker, and looks quite nice

## Thoughts
- I think it's probably worth it to use a clean bowl for the bulk ferment.  Quite a bit of sticking to the bowl.
- Overnight on the counter was too warm - over-proofed.
- Even using the small bowl for proofing, when turning it out it flopped out wide - the membrane isn't strong enough to hold it up.
- Using the rice & white flour blend for dusting tea towels seems to be working very well.  I've somewhat given up on turning out directly into the pan for now though.
