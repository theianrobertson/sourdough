## Bread 6:

Final, start 8:30am Sunday
- 1/2 cup WW flour
- 5 cups White flour
- ~1 tbsp ground sea salt
- 1 3/4 cups water (filtered)
- Kneaded for 15 minutes
- Followed directions in there.  Used damp cloth for covering, and baked like number 1 (450 pre-heat, down to 400 when I put it in, 20 minutes with lid on, then off)

## Bread 7:
Started ~6:30 pm Friday
3/4 sponge:
- 1/2 cup starter
- 3/4 cup water
- 9/8 cup white flour (ish)
- Final - kneaded for ~15 mins at 2:15 pm:
    + 1/3 cup WW flour
    + 4 cups white flour
    + 1.5 cups water
    + 1 tbsp salt
- Turned it out on the counter for kneading this time (with a bit of olive oil on the hands).  Went pretty well, no sticking.
- Same time pattern as before.  Loaf looks decent, but the bottom blew a little bit - we'll see if it's aight. (it was)

## Bread 8:
Started 7:15 pm Friday
Sponge same as Bread 7, but used bottled water (?)

## Bread 9
Start 10:30 pm Friday
2/3 sponge:
1/2 cup starter
1 cup white flour
2/3 cup water (brita from fridge)

Final: 1:00 Saturday
1 1/3 cup water
3 1/3 cup white flour
2/3 cup whole wheat
~1 T salt
Mix 2 minutes, leave for 30 minutes
Knead (fold & stretch) 2 minutes, leave for 1 hr in oiled bowl (in oven with light)
Fold (4 corners), and rise for 1 hr (done)
Fold (4 corners), and rise for 90 minutes
Form, and into a bowl with liner
Into the fridge
Baking started ~8:00, and was slightly disastrous.
- Pre-heated to 450, with the bread in the dutch oven for 45 mins outside of the fridge
- The loaf stuck to the tea towel (not enough flour?)
- Used the 30 mins with lid on, 20 off (stayed at 450 the whole time which I think was a good temp)
- The loaf stuck to the pot too (not enough corn meal)
- Next time, try second fermentation in parchment paper, and transfer right to the pot (hmm)

## Bread 10
Start 6:30 Friday pm
3/4 recipe
- Sponge:
    - 1/2 cup starter
    - 3/4 cup water
    - 9/8 cup white flour (ish)
- Final
    + 2/3 cup WW flour
    + 3 2/3 cups white flour
    + 1.5 cups water
    + 1 tbsp salt

## Bread 11
Doing a full recipe, starting 10:30 pm Friday.  1/2 cup of the flour is WW.  May do half cheesy (garlic?) and half plain.

4 2/3 cups white
1 cup WW
2 cups water
1 tbsp salt
30 mins
90 mins
60 mins
75 mins
Before final fold, I cut it in half.  One I just kept normal, and the other I flattened/stretched out and put on ~6 crushed cloves of garlic, and ~1.5 inches of grated cheddar off a block.  Then folded over a few times, trying to keep the cheese from leaking out.  Into the fridge around 10:30 pm, on parchment with plastic wrap over top.

The cheesy was tasty, but I think too garlicky and could have been more uniformly dispersed through the bread.  Maybe add the garlic and cheese earlier, and potentially with some butter for the garlic?  Or cook the garlic a bit first?

## Bread 12
3/4 recipe, and swapped out 1/2 cup of white for whole wheat in the sponge, and used 1 1/3 cups WW, 3 cups white in the final.  Used a little bit more water maybe.
