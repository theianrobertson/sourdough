# Sourdough!

This is a relatively basic white bread, and can be tweaked to your heart's content.  The whole process takes about 36 hours if you feed the starter the night before, but really only about 30 minutes of actual work.  The times listed are a rough guideline, and can be tweaked to agree with your schedule.

## Starter: t = ~ -12hr

Sometime between dinner and bed the night before starting to bake, you should feed your starter.  When feeding the starter, use a 1:1:1 ratio (by weight) of old starter : flour : water, and a half-and-half mix of white and whole wheat flour.  Throw out the rest of the old starter (or use for sourdough pancakes).  I don't like wasting flour so I'll usually do something like 30g:30g:30g so that I'm not throwing out too much flour.  Keep the starter on the counter overnight, loosely covered.

## Levain: t = 0 (7:00 am)

This recipe uses a relatively young levain, fed in the morning of the bake.  Ideally the starter
should be fed the night before, but in a pinch straight from the fridge will work.

### Ingredients

- 25g Starter, fed from last night or direct from the fridge
- 65g Water - room temperature is fine, or a bit warmer.  Just not fridge-cold.
- 35g White flour
- 35g Whole wheat flour

### Process

- Mix the starter with the water until it's homogenous
- Mix in the flours, taking care to scrape down the sides of your bowl
- Set aside with a loose lid or damp tea towel covering the container.  The starter should be "warmish" - in the winter you can turn the oven on for a couple of minutes then turn it off and let it use the lingering heat in there to stay toasty.  The "proof" setting is too hot to leave the oven on.

## Autolyse: t = 2.5hr (9:30 am)

Flour and water are mixed together for a few hours before mixing in the salt and levain, to hydrate the flour and let the gluten/enzymes/science develop without as much kneading needed.  At this stage you have to decide how much bread you're making, and scale measurements appropriately.  This recipe uses 1000g of flour, and is enough for two loaves.  If you're just making a small batard, scale everything by ~40%.

### Ingredients

- 100g Whole wheat flour
- 900g White flour
- 700g Water

### Variations

You can tweak flour percentages to your heart's content.  Try swapping 50g of the white flour for the same weight of dark rye flour, or buckwheat, spelt, etc. for different flavours.  You can also bump up the percentage of whole wheat, but you may want to increase the amount of water you use since it's "thirstier".

You can also swap out some of the water at this step for beer - a stout pairs very nicely with some cheese as an add-in.

### Process

You just want to mix the flour and water together until there's no (or almost no) dry flour left. I'll usually mix this in a big heavy bowl with a spatula or spurtle to keep my hands clean, as the dough is quite sticky at this stage.

## Dough mix: t = 5.5hr (12:30 pm)

This is the most labour-intensive step.

### Ingredients

- 20g salt (fine is easier, but coarse should be fine too)
- Levain from before (160g)
- Autolysed flour
- 100g water
- A handful (~1/2 cup?) of your favourite add-ins (optional)
  - Walnuts/raisins/cinnamon
  - Mixed seeds (poppy/flax/sesame/black sesame/sunflower/etc.)
  - Cheese in 0.5cm cubes (v. nice if you swap out some of the water for beer in the autolyse step)
  - Roasted garlic/rosemary (probably not a half cup, but you do you)
  - Dried cherries/pecans

### Process

- Scoop the levain, water and salt into the same bowl as the flour and water, on a clear & clean part of your counter (for kneading/slapping).  Get any bowls ready if you're using different bowls for bulk fermentation (necessary if you're making two different kinds of bread)
- Wet your hands, and cut/pinch/fold the dough together until the water has mostly been incorporated.  You can also use this step to get all the dry bits of flour off the bowl and into the dough.  The dough will come apart as you mix, but should start coming back together.
- Tip the dough out onto the counter, and use a spatula/rubber dough scraper to scoop out any bits of dough with it.
- Slap and fold the dough for 5-10 minutes, until it comes together and starts looking pretty smooth ([reference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0msYMpMJ8)).  Keeping your hands a bit wet throughout can help with keeping your hands from getting too messy.
- Add in any add-ins at the end of the slap and fold, by spreading the dough out on the counter, spreading the add-ins on top of if, and kind of stretching/rolling the dough back onto itself, covering the add-ins.  
- Put the dough back into your bowl (or new bowls), cover loosely with a lid or damp tea towel
- Keep the dough at warm room temperature - same as above in levain instructions.

## Stretchin' and Foldin'

Stretch and fold the dough three times in the bowl, at 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the dough mix ([reference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjuGBf6l-68)).  Use a gentler touch as you go.

## Pre-shape: t = 10.5hr (5:30 pm)

- Gently release the dough out onto a clean countertop, not floured.  You can use a bowl scraper here, or if necessary do another stretch & fold in the bowl.
- Divide into how many loaves you're making, dust with white flour and use a bench knife to gently shape into a round mound, with some tension.
- Cover with a towel or bowl for 20-30 minutes.

## Shape: t = 11hr (6:00 pm)

- Sprinkle a lined basket/bowl with a 1:1 mix of white and rice flour (I just keep this mixed up)
- Dust your hands and the dough with flour, and use the bench knife to flip over.
- Stretch & stitch ([reference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YSzK4_uM6s)) to do the final shape.  Let rest for a minute or two.
- Use the bench knife to scoop up the finished loaf and place upside-down in the basket
- Cover lightly with a shower cap or in a bag with some air in it.  Leave on the counter for 1.5 hours, then into the fridge overnight.

## Bake: t = 24hr (ish - next morning)

- Preheat the oven to 470°F, with your pan in there
- Either tip the loaf directly into the pan with some cornmeal sprinkled in the bottom, or onto parchment paper then slide the parchment paper into the pot.
- Slash the dough slightly off the centre line with a razor blade/sharp knife, or use scissors to snip it
- Bake covered for 20 minutes, then uncovered for 15-20 at 450°.
- Cool completely (or mostly) before cutting and eatin'
