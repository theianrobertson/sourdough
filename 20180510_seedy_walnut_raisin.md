# Seedy raisin x 1, Raisin walnut x 1

## Ingredients
- 850g flour - 460 white, 150 arva, 200 ww, 40 rye
- 212 g leaven
- 650g water to start, 40 with salt
- 20 g salt
- Added just before first turn (dumped out onto counter, spread on top and mixed gently):
    + First loaf (~761g):
        * ~1/3 cup of mixed sesame seeds, flax, poppy and pepitas (Maybe a bit more?)
        * 50 g raisins
    + Second loaf (~1000g):
        * 90 g walnuts
        * 60 g raisins
        * 1 tbsp walnut oil
        * 1 tsp cinnamon

## Process
- Made levain overnight with 1-1-1 ratios
- First mix ~8:00 am
- 35 minute autolyze
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 2 15 minute folds, 5 30 minute folds, extras mixed in with first fold, tried to get some tension after third.
- 2 more hours
- 5 hours total bulk, no fold at end.
- Pre-shape
- 25 minutes, 20 covered and 5 uncovered, then final shape, into boule (nutty)and batard (seedy).  Batard got spritzed and sesame seeded
- Into the fridge around 3:00
- Bake 20-20 at 450, in the oven at 6:15 the next morning

## Notes
- Pretty good slash on the dough after that time in the fridge
- Seedy raisin bread was quite tasty - nice mix of flavours
