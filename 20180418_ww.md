# Whole Wheat

- 920g flour - 55 spelt, 150 arva white, 715 ww
- 230 g leaven
- 750g water to start, 50 with salt
- Heaping tablespoon of honey
- 22 g salt


- Made levain in the morning with 1-1-1 ratios (50-50 flour white and ww)
- First mix ~7:00 pm
- 40 minute autolyze
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding

- Honestly I just forgot to keep many notes on this.  Long story short I think I didn't let it rise long enough.
