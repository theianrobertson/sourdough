# More whole wheat

## Ingredients
- Levain:
  - 25g starter fed from last night
  - 35g Arva White
  - 35g whole wheat
  - 65g warm water
- Dough:
  - 350g whole wheat
  - 50g buckwheat
  - 600g white (300 white, 300 arva)
  - 800g water (700g with dough mix, 100 with salt/levain)
  - 20g salt
  - all the levain (160g)

## Process
- Mixed up levain around 7:15 am
- Mix dough sans-levain/salt at 10:15 am
- Mixed everything together and slapped & folded for a bit at ~12:30
- 3 stretch & folds on the 30s, second got some seeds?
- Pre-shape around 5:20 pm
- Shape around 5:40 pm - one batard and one pullman pan
- On the counter for 1:00 and it was already looking pretty bubbly

- Baked 25 at 460 with lid on, 25 at 450 with lid off (last 5 out of pot)

## Notes
- Dough was very bubbly, and spilled over the sides a bit.  Maybe go right in to the fridge next time?
- Batard was flat like a pancake.  Over-proofed (I think).
