# One cheesy, one seedy

## Ingredients
- 800g flour - 460 white, 150 arva, 150 ww, 40 rye
- 200 g leaven
- 610g water to start, 40 with salt
- 19 g salt

- Added just before first turn (dumped out onto counter, spread on top and mixed gently):
    + First loaf (Smaller):
        * One onion, diced and cooked down in butter for a bit
        * Cheddar cheese - 87 g in ~1cm cubes - 5 thick slices chopped up
    + Second loaf:
        * ~1/3 cup of mixed sesame seeds, flax, poppy and pepitas (Maybe a bit more?)
        * 50 g raisins

## Process
- Made levain overnight with 1-1-1 ratios
- First mix ~8:00 am
- 35 minute autolyze
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 6 30 minute folds, extras mixed in with first fold, tried to get some tension after third.
- 2 more hours
- 5 hours total bulk, no fold at end.
- Pre-shape
- 25 minutes, 20 covered and 5 uncovered, then final shape, into boule (seedy)and batard (cheesy).
- Into the fridge around 3:00
- Bake 20-20 at 450, in the oven at 7:30 the next morning

## Notes
- Pretty good slash on the dough after that time in the fridge
- Cheesy bread v. tasty, but not very risen.  Maybe could have shaped it a bit tighter?  Or stitched in the basket.
