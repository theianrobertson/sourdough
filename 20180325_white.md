# White (white!)

- 850g flour - 500 white, 250 arva white, 100 ww
- 596g water for autolyze, 40g water with levain, 44 with salt
- 200 g leaven

- 20 g salt

- Made levain overnight with 1-1-1 ratios

- 1 hour autolyze with just flour/water
- Cut in levain and more water, 30 minutes
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 4 15 minute folds, tried to get some tension after second.
- 1 more 30 minute fold
- 3.5 more hours
- 5 hours total bulk, folded at end.  Mostly on the counter.
- Pre-shape
- 25 minutes then final shape, into boule and batard.
- On the counter for 3 hours, then bake.
- Bake 20-18 at 450

## Notes
- This would have benefitted from being in the fridge I think, and probably more stretchy foldy.
