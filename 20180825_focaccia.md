Originally from [here](http://www.larecettedujour.org/2015/07/sourdough-focaccia.php)

## Ingredients
- Sponge
  - 200 g liquid starter (100% hydration)
  - 125 g warm water
  - 25 g olive oil
  - 10 g honey
  - 50 g plain flour
- Dough, add
  - 50 g olive oil
  - 200 g flour
  - 1 tsp sea salt
- Topping:
  - Topping of your choice
  - Olive oil
  - Sea salt/fleur de sel

## Process
- Mixed up sponge at 8:00 am, leave at room temp for 2 hours
- Mix dough at 10:00 am - surface of sponge should be covered in small bubbles
  - Use a wooden spoon or dough hook to stir in remaining oil, flour, and salt.
  - Leave to stand for 15-30 minutes. Then, use one floured hand to pull and stretch the dough in
    the bowl, folding it back on itself. It will be messy, but just accept it.
  - Repeat the rest/stretch/fold x 4 on 15 minutes.
  - Dough should look smoother and more homoegeneous
- Rub the inside of a large bowl with olive oil and turn the dough into it.
- Refrigerate the dough overnight, or let it prove for 2-3 hours at room temperature until it has
  almost doubled in volume.
- Preheat the oven to 425F.
- Line a baking sheet of at least 20 x 30 cm with parchment paper and smear the paper with olive oil.
- Tip the dough onto it and use floured hands to spread and stretch it into a rough oblong.
- Cover with a cloth and leave to rise for 20-30 minutes while the oven heats and you prepare whatever toppings you have chosen.
- When ready to bake, use a finger to “dib” little dimples in the top of the dough. Drizzle with
  olive oil, then scatter over your chosen topping(s). Drizzle on some more oil and sprinkle with
  sea salt or fleur de sel.
- Bake for 20-30 minutes until the focaccia is golden and the edges are starting to crisp. Cool on
  a wire rack before cutting into squares.
