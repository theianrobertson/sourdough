# Cherry Pecan Walnut bread

[Original recipe motivation](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/sour-cherry-toasted-pecan-buckwheat-levain/)

## Ingredients
- 850g flour - 550 white, 150 arva, 125 ww, 25 buckwheat
- 212 g leaven
- 650g water to start, 40 with salt
- 20 g salt
- Added just before second turn (dumped out onto counter, spread on top and mixed gently):
    + ~80 g pecans
    + ~70 g walnuts
    + 115 g dried cherries

## Process
- Made levain overnight with 1-1-1 ratios
- First mix ~11:30 am
- 35 minute autolyze
- Cut in salt, with some slap & folding
- 6 30 minute folds, one 1 hr fold, extras mixed in with second fold, tried to get some tension
  after third.
- 1/2 more hour, 4.5 hours total bulk, no fold at end.
- Pre-shape
- 25 minutes, 20 covered and 5 uncovered, then final shape, into boule and batard.
- Into the fridge around 5:00
- Bake 20-20 at 450, in the oven at 10:45 the next morning

## Notes
- Buckwheat made the dough look nice - looked like vanilla ice cream
- Decently active after 4.5 hours so cut bulk a bit shorter than expected
