# Seedy bread

- 850g flour - 600 white, 100 Arva white, 150 total ww/spelt
- 212 g leaven
- 637g water to start, 42.5 with salt
- 20 g salt
- Added just before first turn (Cut in with my fingers in the bowl mostly):
    + ~1/2 cup of mixed black & white sesame seeds, and poppy seeds.

- Made levain overnight with 1-1-1 ratios

## Notes
- One loaf in the fridge overnight, one just on the counter for 3 hours.  Didn't seem to make too much of a difference visually anyway, though the former was easier to slash.
